description:
 This check monitors the state of ZFS pools. It uses a "coarse" grained
 system command, "zpool -H", reporting on the global usage and state of a whole
 pool and not treating the pool as a "filesystem" like the zfsget check.
 Also, this check returns an item for every defined pool and it is not generic
 as the default zpool_status check, which shows the state of all pools in a
 single nagios check.

item:
 a zpool

examples:
 # Set default levels for all pools
 solaris_zpool_default_levels["levels"] = (90.0, 95.0)

 check_parameters = [
    # Hosts with tag "production" get 85/95
    ( {'levels': (85.0, 95.0), 'critical_state': None}, ['production', ], ALL_HOSTS, ALL_SERVICES ),
 ]

 # Exclude pool from inventory
 inventory_solaris_zpool_exclude_pool = [ "rpool-sldmxe" ]

perfdata:
 Usage levels are saved into the rrd database.

inventory:
 This check supports inventory.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): this check supports the new parameters dictionary format.

{"levels"}: Warning and critical usage levels
{"critical_state"}: State string to use as a critical state, as returned by "zpool -H"

[configuration]
inventory_solaris_zpool_exclude_pool (list of strings): List of pools to exclude from inventory
solaris_zpool_default_levels: Default levels for pool usage and status
